In the rapidly evolving retail landscape, supermarkets play a pivotal role in catering to the diverse needs of consumers. With the advent of technology, supermarkets now generate vast amounts of data through various channels, including point-of-sale (POS) systems, customer loyalty programs, online transactions, and supply chain operations.
